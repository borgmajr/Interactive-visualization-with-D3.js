Prerequisites and Resources


# Prerequisites
This liveProject is for developers having at least basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Being comfortable with data manipulation in JavaScript, like filtering an array or accessing key-value pairs in an object, will help you tremendously.
Basic knowledge of D3.js is also expected. You should know how to select DOM elements, load datasets, bind data and append shapes to the DOM. If you are not familiar with these concepts, we recommend starting with the first project of this series.

* TOOLS
   * Code editor of choice
   * Local server (VS Code's Live Server extension is a good and easy to use option)
   * Browser of choice
   * Your willingness to break down problems, experiment and find creative solutions!


* TECHNIQUES
   * Using `d3.bin()` to bin data
   * D3's line and area generators
   * D3's force simulations
   * Event listeners
   * SVG filters
