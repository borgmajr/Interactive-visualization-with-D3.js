# about this liveProject
Developers often turn to D3.js for its immense flexibility, which allows them to create unique data visualizations. Instead of providing functions that display specific charts, D3 gives us access to building blocks that can be used and assembled in many ways. This project will be an occasion to experiment with this flexibility and to evolve a standard and straightforward chart, a basic histogram, into a much more intricate and interactive visualization, as you can see on [the completed project here](https://manning.box.com/s/utqm8aba7e9k36nsvd66i0rrw6q9k5h9).


# Techniques employed

This project will allow you to gain a fair understanding of how to represent distributions with D3. You will also get introduced to D3â€™s force layout to position SVG shapes on a visualization based on a physical simulation. Finally, you will listen to mouse events to reveal a tooltip and play with SVG filters.

* Binning data with D3.
* Using this binned data to generate a histogram, a curve and a density plot.
* Creating a complex layout from a rich dataset.
* Using D3's force layout to position elements within a visualization.
* Listening to mouse event to reveal a tooltip.
* Appending SVG filters to create unique visual effects.


# Project outline

This liveProject will be broken into four milestones.

**1. Play with Distributions**

**2. Illustrate the gender pay gap in sports**

**3. Add individual players to the visualization**

**4. Make the visualization interactive and add special visual effects**



# Libraries and setup

For this project, you will only need a local development environment, including a local server. If required, refer to the first milestone of project 1, where we explained how to use VS Code and its Live Server extension to generate the required environment.

We will provide a folder containing the project structure and the data in milestone 1.
