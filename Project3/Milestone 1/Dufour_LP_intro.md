# about this liveProject

The Academy Awards ceremony hosted in 2021 marked a milestone. Never before in their history have the Oscar nominated so many artists from the Black and Asian community. But this haven't always been the case.

In this liveProject, we will create a data visualization of the representation of ethnic minorities at the Academy Awards ceremony, thouhout its history and for some of its most prestigious award.

As you can see [here](https://manning.box.com/s/9ou2t0oqqmyxmw116ormydlzid0vyap0), this visualization will be interactive with the tooltip and the usage of filters. It will also be fully responsive.


# Techniques employed

We are about to build a fun and engaging project, throughout which you will learn:

* How to use D3's stack generator to stack areas, or SVG paths, upon each other and generate an eye-catching stream graph.
* Listen to mouse events and build a complex tooltip.
* Break SVG text upon multiple lines.
* Apply filters to a visualization.
* Use smooth transitions between states.
* Make a responsive visualization.

Let's go!
